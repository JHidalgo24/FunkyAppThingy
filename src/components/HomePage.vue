            <v-card-text>
              Let's be honest here, how many times have you gone out with someone and everything is going great. Good
              food,
              having some laughs everything is breezy until they bust out some wack-ass music. I'm talking real wack
              like you
              can't get jiggy with it any more. Well, now you can put those moments behind you.

              Okay so you get why you should join but what exactly is the deal with music anyway?
              Listen I don't know about you but geeking out over a specific band or song is super cool.
              The vibes are there, you guys have a connection, having fun. Why? all because you both
              have similar tastes in music. This app will pair people up based on what music they like.
              We're talking genres, artist, songs, playlists.

              This app will pair people up based on mutual music interests.
              Simply enter the asked information when signing up, and you will
              be on your way to meeting some great people. Not only are we
              considerate to people's political views, but we also take
              into consideration what you might want to present to people.
              We do keep all of the information to ourselves. We do not
              sell our user information. Scouts honor.

              If you've made a feature or an idea, we thank you for this.
              This is our first major app that we have worked on, and any
              bit of help is greatly appreciated. It wouldn't be the same
              without any one thought from you. :widepeepohappy:
